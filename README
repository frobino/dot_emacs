TODO NEXT:
     - EDE
     - understand why some of the autocomplete techniques give troubles
     - howto remove yas messages?

TODO list (X = done, ? = suspended, * = to be done):

     X sr_speedbar: speedbar in console (not in frame)
       Main shortcuts:
       M-x sr-speedbar-toggle
       SPC open/close children of a node
       RET to open

     X EDE: project manager, improve auto completion. Usually pre installed, no need for package install.
       EDE enables semantics to find sources & perform project level compilation.
       C-x C-e activates ede to load the cedet-project.el file
       Otherwise M-x load-file RET /path/to/myproject.el containing ede-cpp-root-project
       Required to be started from .emacs file to expand semantics parser!

     ? ECB: IDE 
       NOTE: I tried EDE but it seems slow and not fully supported on all platforms, 
       e.g. troubles with cygwin, see ecb FAQ. Suspended for the moment.        

     X company-c-header: auto completion for headers
       NOTES: about company-c-header
       Use writing #include < then tab_
       Add library path with the following:
       (add-to-list 'company-c-headers-path-system "/usr/include/c++/4.8/")

     * check global-semantic-idle-summary-mode

     * narrowing: making only a text portion in current buffer visible.
     Narrowing is useful when you want to perform text editing on a small part of
     the buffer without affecting the others. For example, you want to delete
     all printf statements in current functions, using flush-lines command. 

     * indentation:

     X yasnippet: function templates
       NOTE: use a shortcut such as for then tab

     X compilation support:
       F5

     * debugging and gdb integration:

     X ggtags: source code navigation through TAGS
       Run gtags in folder, M-, and M-.

     * helm-gtags: source code navigation through TAGS 

     X undo-tree:
       a MUST for all projects. Should be always active
       C-_ M-_ : do/undo
       C-x u   : open undo tree, navigate with arrows

     X smartparens-config

     X golden-ratio: automatically adjust window size
       NOTE: not added in .el file. If needed, install through pkg-mng and
       activate with M-x golden-ratio-mode
