TODO list (X = done, ? = suspended, * = to be done):

     X sr_speedbar: speedbar in console (not in frame)

     ? EDE: project manager, improve auto completion.
       EDE enables semantics to find sources & perform project level compilation

     ? ECB: IDE 
       NOTE: I tried EDE but it seems slow and not fully supported on all platforms, 
       e.g. troubles with cygwin, see ecb FAQ. Suspended for the moment.        

     X company-c-header: auto completion for headers

     * check global-semantic-idle-summary-mode

     * narrowing: making only a text portion in current buffer visible.
     Narrowing is useful when you want to perform text editing on a small part of
     the buffer without affecting the others. For example, you want to delete
     all printf statements in current functions, using flush-lines command. 

     * indentation:

     X yasnippet: function templates

     X compilation support:

     * debugging and gdb integration:

     X ggtags: source code navigation through TAGS 

     * helm-gtags: source code navigation through TAGS 

     * undo-tree:
       a MUST for all projects. Should be always active
       C-_ M-_ : do/undo
       C-x u   : open undo tree, navigate with arrows

     X smartparens-config

     X golden-ratio: automatically adjust window size
       NOTE: not added in .el file. If needed, install through pkg-mng and
       activate with M-x golden-ratio-mode
