TODO NEXT:
     - understand why some of the autocomplete techniques give troubles
     - howto remove yas messages?
     - ctags better parser (make your own rules) to tag also constants, etc.
     - write a proper readme, describing steps for browsing c and vhdl code. 

TODO list (X = done, ? = suspended, * = to be done):

     ALL CODE MODE (emacs_all_code_config.el):

     X undo-tree:
       a MUST for all projects. Should be always active
       C-_ M-_ : do/undo
       C-x u   : open undo tree, navigate with arrows

     X golden-ratio: automatically adjust window size
       NOTE: not added in .el file. If needed, install through pkg-mng and
       activate with M-x golden-ratio-mode

     C CODE MODE (emacs_c_code_config.el):

     X sr_speedbar: speedbar in console (not in frame)
       Main shortcuts:
       M-x sr-speedbar-toggle
       SPC open/close children of a node
       RET to open

     X EDE: project manager, improve auto completion. Usually pre installed, no need for package install.
       EDE enables semantics to find sources & perform project level compilation.
       C-x C-e activates ede to load the cedet-project.el file
       Otherwise M-x load-file RET /path/to/myproject.el containing ede-cpp-root-project
       Required to be started from .emacs file to expand semantics parser!
       NOTE: cedet-project.el does NOT need to be in a specific folder (e.g. .emacs.d/),
             but it can be in any folder, also the project folder!
             
     X Semantics: auto completion #1 with active parser
       It is already included in all new version of emacs. 
       As default, it parses and autocomplete only the current file. To specify where headers and other files are, 
       we must load an ede project first which specifies (at least) the root folder. <--- !
       To autocomplete the classic functions (such as printf from stdio):
       WIN: semantic-add-system-include "e:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0/VC/include"
       Look in semantic-dependency-system-include-path variable which path are included for the system libraries
       
     X Company with different backends (semantic, clang, gtags,...): auto completion #2
       semantic : ok if config semantic
       clang: requires clang installed in PATH
       ...

     ? ECB: IDE 
       NOTE: I tried EDE but it seems slow and not fully supported on all platforms, 
       e.g. troubles with cygwin, see ecb FAQ. Suspended for the moment.        

     X company-c-header: auto completion for headers
       NOTES: about company-c-header
       Use writing #include < then tab_
       Add library path with the following:
       (add-to-list 'company-c-headers-path-system "/usr/include/c++/4.8/")

     * check global-semantic-idle-summary-mode

     * narrowing: making only a text portion in current buffer visible.
     Narrowing is useful when you want to perform text editing on a small part of
     the buffer without affecting the others. For example, you want to delete
     all printf statements in current functions, using flush-lines command. 

     * indentation:

     X yasnippet: function templates
       NOTE: use a shortcut such as for then tab

     X compilation support:
       F5

     * debugging and gdb integration:

     X ggtags: source code navigation through TAGS
       Run gtags in folder, M-, and M-.

     * helm-gtags: source code navigation through TAGS 

     X smartparens-config

     VHDL CODE MODE (emacs_vhdl_code_config.el):

     X ctags support:
     Similar to gtags for navigating C code, we use ctags (a.k.a. etags or Exuberant Ctags)
     to create a TAGS file helping to browse our vhdl code. The .el file is not a library,
     but implements some useful functions. 
     Run the following command in the top folder containing your project: 
     ctags -e -R --languages=vhdl . 
     Browsing VHDL:
     M-. to find the entity declaration of an instantiated component (TOP DOWN).
     ctags-search (from the entity declaration) to find the place in code where it is istantiated (BOTTOM UP). Continue search trough ETAGS through M-,
     TODO: find a technique similar to occur (M-s o) instead of M-, continuously (or rgrep)

     C# CODE MODE

     * evaluate csharp-mode

     * look at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSharpMode and consider Flymake, RFringe, HideShow (to be extendend to C mode? ) and Omnisharp
